Hello! I'm Xiaoyang Wang, a PhD student at [Drexel University](https://drexel.edu) advised by Prof. [Christopher C. Yang](https://cci.drexel.edu/faculty/cyang/) in the Health Informatics Research Group. My research interests include Fair & Trustworthy Artificial Intelligence (AI), machine learning, and health informatics.

My research is driven by the pursuit of developing fair and interpretable machine learning models to improve decision-making in the healthcare domain. I am deeply passionate about the ethical aspects of artificial intelligence, with a particular emphasis on fairness and explainability. My goal is to devise AI systems that are ethical, transparent, and universally beneficial, thereby maximizing its potential to enrich human life.

Prior to my Ph.D life at Drexel, I received my master degree at [the University of Pittsburgh](https://www.pitt.edu/), and I was advised by Prof. [Peter Brusilovsky](https://www.sci.pitt.edu/people/peter-brusilovsky). I received my bachelorâ€™s degree at [Shanghai Normal University](https://shnu.edu.cn/).
